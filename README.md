Creating Wireframe and Photoshop Mockups

This repository contains files and documentation created during the setup, creation and development of a wireframe, high-fidelity mockup and full implementation of these mockups using Bootstrap.  This project was developed in conjunction with the course *Creating Wireframe and Photoshop Mockups* at Treehouse.

The drivers behind this project are to learn how to create wireframes in various ways.

## Technology:
- [x] High-fidelity mockups in Photoshop
- [x] Bootstrap wireframes

#### Fig.2 - Photoshop High-Fidelity Mockup
This mockup shows more detail, gives a better taste of what real UI elements might look like, and makes it easier to communicate functionality prior to development.
